**5** `||blocks: place block at position||` commands ,with either **PUMPKIN** or **MELON_BLOCK**, at the correct location variable 
to match the crop at the coordinate. To see the coordinates and coding window at same time, click on the half coding window button in the top left-hand corner.

```template
location1 = world(-24, 40, -18)
location2 = world(-31, 40, -11)
location3 = world(-28, 40, -16)
location4 = world(-25, 40, -13)
location5 = world(-31, 40, -17)
//Replace the lines below with your code #
