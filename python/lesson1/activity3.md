### @explicitHints true


## Step 1
Look at each of the tv monitors, calculate the sums using code.
To use the mathematical value of numbers in a command, quotes should **not** be used. For example:
```python
# @highlight
player.say(1+1) 
```
When this code is run it gives the result **2**. Work out the correct answers of the sums on the tv monitors and select the corresponding buttons.
