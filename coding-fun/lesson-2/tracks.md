# Program the Agent to move along the turtle tracks!

## Step 1
Move the Agent along the turtle tracks by using an ``||agent: agent move forward||`` block to the gates. When done, press the **Play** button to compile the code. Don't forget to run your code in Minecraft. 

```ghost
player.onChat("tracks", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
})
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
 }
```
